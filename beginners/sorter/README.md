SORTER
===
This problem tests your knowledge of Java arrays, and the ability to write simple sorting alogirthms. You may use recursion.

Basic version
---
You are given an array of Strings as input. You need to arrange the Strings in ascending order *in the same array*. You can use temporary arrays. Also print the last element of the array and see if it is the greatest string or not.

Advanced version
---
You are given an array of objects of class as given below:
``` java
public class SimpleThing {
    public String nothingSpecial;
    public int stillNothingSpecial;
}
```

You need to arrange the objects in ascending order according to the property *nothingSpecial*, and *in the same array*. Again, you may use temporary arrays.
